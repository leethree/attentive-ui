============

Research project on attentive UI for Android devices.

by **Li Sirui**, Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong.

## Overview

The system is the implementation of Attentive Gestural User Interfaces, which make use of eye input data from eye trackers to augment touch-screen interfaces.

**Supermonkey**, **trackerd** are core components of the system. The folder **scripts** includes tool scripts of the system. **MonkeyDemo** and **FactFinder** are applications running on the system. **HoverLib** is an interface library used by the applications.

The system is developed and tested using Tobii X1 Light Eye Tracker and ASUS Nexus 7 (2012) Android tablet.

## trackerd

Daemon for eye trackers. It works as a service that provides network interfaces for controlling the eye tracker as well as the ability to send eye-tracking data over the network.

#### Runtime environment:
* Windows
* Python 2.6
* Tobii SDK 3.0 RC1 (now known as [Tobii Analytics SDK](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-tracking-research/global/products/software/tobii-analytics-software-development-kit/)) for Win32
* A Tobii eye tracker that is supported by the above SDK 

#### Run:
```console
python trackerd.py
```

#### Network:
Listens to port 10800, connects to Monkey via port 1080.

## SuperMonkey

A client for trackerd, which controls the eye tracker on the host PC from Android device. It is a regular Android app that connects to trackerd via TCP sockets and provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for users.

A modified version of [_UI/Application Exerciser Monkey_ by Android](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html) is bundled with SuperMonkey.

#### Runtime environment:
* _Rooted_ Android 4.2

#### Development environment:
* Android SDK 14+
* Android SDK Platform with internal classes (please refer to [this](http://devmaze.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/using-com-android-internal-part-1-introduction/))

#### Install monkey:
1. Install SuperMonkey just as a normal app. 
2. Put file `scripts/supermonkey.sh` into `/data/` on Android file system
3. Correct its permissions.

Please see `scripts/install_monkey.bat` for details.

#### Run monkey:
1. Connect Android device with USB Debugging.
2. Set up port forwarding with ADB:
`
adb forward tcp:1080 tcp:1080
`
3. Run monkey from Android shell:

```bash
sh /data/supermonkey.sh --port 1080 --ignore-crashes
```

Then you can start trackerd and SuperMonkey app. Please see `scripts/monkey.bat` for details.

#### Network:
Monkey listens to port 1080 on the Android system.
Supermonkey connects to trackerd via port 10800.

## HoverLib, MonkeyDemo, and FactFinder

**HoverLib**: Library project of Android interface components that supports attentive input.

**MonkeyDemo**: Demo application for the above interface components.

**FactFinder**: Renamed as "FoodFinder" in its interface, sample application that makes use of the components.

Note: The interfaces are optimised for 7-inch screen with 1280Ã—800-pixels resolution in landscape mode. Slight changes to layout might be needed on other configurations.

#### Runtime environment:
* Android 4.2

#### Development environment:
* Android SDK 16+
* Android support library v4 and v13
* [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) 4.4.0 with a tiny bit of modification

You can find the modified ActionBarSherlock [here](https://github.com/leethree/ActionBarSherlock/tree/hover).

The applications also include source code files from [Android Open-Source Project](http://source.android.com/) (AOSP) and [Android swipe-to-dismiss mini-library](https://github.com/romannurik/Android-SwipeToDismiss) by Roman Nurik.
