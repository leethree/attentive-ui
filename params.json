{"name":"Attentive-ui","tagline":"A research project on attentive UI for Android devices.","body":"by **Li Sirui**, Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe system is the implementation of Attentive Gestural User Interfaces, which make use of eye input data from eye trackers to augment touch-screen interfaces.\r\n\r\n**Supermonkey**, **trackerd** are core components of the system. The folder **scripts** includes tool scripts of the system. **MonkeyDemo** and **FactFinder** are applications running on the system. **HoverLib** is an interface library used by the applications.\r\n\r\nThe system is developed and tested using Tobii X1 Light Eye Tracker and ASUS Nexus 7 (2012) Android tablet.\r\n\r\n## trackerd\r\n\r\nDaemon for eye trackers. It works as a service that provides network interfaces for controlling the eye tracker as well as the ability to send eye-tracking data over the network.\r\n\r\n#### Runtime environment:\r\n* Windows\r\n* Python 2.6\r\n* Tobii SDK 3.0 RC1 (now known as [Tobii Analytics SDK](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-tracking-research/global/products/software/tobii-analytics-software-development-kit/)) for Win32\r\n* A Tobii eye tracker that is supported by the above SDK \r\n\r\n#### Run:\r\n```console\r\npython trackerd.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Network:\r\nListens to port 10800, connects to Monkey via port 1080.\r\n\r\n## SuperMonkey\r\n\r\nA client for trackerd, which controls the eye tracker on the host PC from Android device. It is a regular Android app that connects to trackerd via TCP sockets and provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for users.\r\n\r\nA modified version of [_UI/Application Exerciser Monkey_ by Android](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html) is bundled with SuperMonkey.\r\n\r\n#### Runtime environment:\r\n* _Rooted_ Android 4.2\r\n\r\n#### Development environment:\r\n* Android SDK 14+\r\n* Android SDK Platform with internal classes (please refer to [this](http://devmaze.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/using-com-android-internal-part-1-introduction/))\r\n\r\n#### Install monkey:\r\n1. Install SuperMonkey just as a normal app. \r\n2. Put file `scripts/supermonkey.sh` into `/data/` on Android file system\r\n3. Correct its permissions.\r\n\r\nPlease see `scripts/install_monkey.bat` for details.\r\n\r\n#### Run monkey:\r\n1. Connect Android device with USB Debugging.\r\n2. Set up port forwarding with ADB:\r\n`\r\nadb forward tcp:1080 tcp:1080\r\n`\r\n3. Run monkey from Android shell:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsh /data/supermonkey.sh --port 1080 --ignore-crashes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can start trackerd and SuperMonkey app. Please see `scripts/monkey.bat` for details.\r\n\r\n#### Network:\r\nMonkey listens to port 1080 on the Android system.\r\nSupermonkey connects to trackerd via port 10800.\r\n\r\n## HoverLib, MonkeyDemo, and FactFinder\r\n\r\n**HoverLib**: Library project of Android interface components that supports attentive input.\r\n\r\n**MonkeyDemo**: Demo application for the above interface components.\r\n\r\n**FactFinder**: Renamed as \"FoodFinder\" in its interface, sample application that makes use of the components.\r\n\r\nNote: The interfaces are optimised for 7-inch screen with 1280Ã—800-pixels resolution in landscape mode. Slight changes to layout might be needed on other configurations.\r\n\r\n#### Runtime environment:\r\n* Android 4.2\r\n\r\n#### Development environment:\r\n* Android SDK 16+\r\n* Android support library v4 and v13\r\n* [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) 4.4.0 with a tiny bit of modification\r\n\r\nYou can find the modified ActionBarSherlock [here](https://github.com/leethree/ActionBarSherlock/tree/hover).\r\n\r\nThe applications also include source code files from [Android Open-Source Project](http://source.android.com/) (AOSP) and [Android swipe-to-dismiss mini-library](https://github.com/romannurik/Android-SwipeToDismiss) by Roman Nurik.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor more detailed and in-depth information regarding this project, please refer to my thesis _Attentive Gestural Interface on Touch Screens_ (to be appear at [The HKU Scholars Hub](http://hub.hku.hk/advanced-search?field1=title&thesis=1)).\r\n\r\nLast updated: 13 Sep 2013.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2013 Sirui Li\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
